# Air Quality Index (AQI) - Exploratory Data Analysis
### Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing air quality data to understand pollution trends and the behavior of various pollutants over time. Using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), the dataset has been cleaned, visualized, and interpreted to derive meaningful insights.

### EDA Highlights
The following analyses were conducted:

1. Data Cleaning
2. Visualizations
3. Insights Derived

### Tools and Libraries Used
- Python:
    - Pandas: Data manipulation and analysis.
    - Matplotlib/Seaborn: Visualizations.
    - NumPy: Statistical computations.

### Acknowledgments
